# MethodsDBCH
Automation of the selection of methods for solving mathematical problems, problems of cryptography, cosmology, digital signal processing.

The MethodsDBCH software package can be used by specialists interested in selecting a data processing method in large computer ranges, suitable for the conditions of the theoretical or practical problem being solved, as well as specialists in the field of large-range computing, who can replenish or change information about methods entered in the registry.
## Functionality
