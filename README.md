# MethodsDBCH
Automation of the selection of methods for solving mathematical problems, problems of cryptography, cosmology, digital signal processing.

The MethodsDBCH software package can be used by specialists interested in selecting a data processing method in large computer ranges, suitable for the conditions of the theoretical or practical problem being solved, as well as specialists in the field of large-range computing, who can replenish or change information about methods entered in the registry.
## Functionality
- Сollection and processing of information about methods of computation in large computer ranges, namely:
  - algorithm class;
  - computational complexity class;
  - area of tasks to be solved (mathematical problems);
  - area of practical application (practical tasks);
  - related theorems;
  - work restrictions;
  - number of execution stages;
  - the amount of occupied internal and external memory;
  - computational complexity value (O- and L-notations).
- output of reports containing detailed information about the methods;
- output of reports on changes that are made to the register of methods by users;
- user data management;
