# MethodsDBCH
Automation of the selection of methods for solving mathematical problems, problems of cryptography, cosmology, digital signal processing.

The MethodsDBCH software package can be used by specialists interested in selecting a modular arithmetic method for data processing in large computational ranges. When selecting, the conditions of the theoretical or practical problem being solved are taken into account. Users-specialists in the field of large computational ranges can add to or change information about the methods included in the registry.
## Functionality
- Сollection and processing of information about methods of computation in large computer ranges, namely:
  - algorithm class;
  - computational complexity class;
  - area of tasks to be solved (mathematical problems);
  - area of practical application (practical tasks);
  - related theorems;
  - work restrictions;
  - number of execution stages;
  - the amount of occupied internal and external memory;
  - computational complexity value (O- and L-notations).
- Output of reports containing detailed information about the methods.
- Output of reports on changes that are made to the register of methods by users.
- User data management.
